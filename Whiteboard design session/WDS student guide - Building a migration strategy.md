# Building an infrastructure migration strategy whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this whiteboard design session, you will understand the business need and compelling event leading to a migration and modernization. The compelling event can be defined by financial criteria, regional business drivers, sustainability, security and compliance need or the timing for new products and services the customers is launching.  Position customer needs first in all activities. Be knowledgeable about Cloud industry terms like Gartner 5Rs. 

At the end of the workshop, you will understand how to communicate the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework with the customer and build a holistic business case for apps, infrastructure, and data.  You will know how to engage a solution assessment with an AMMP partner to assist the customer in their migration.  You will understand how to address customer objections, such as response to AWS and Google competitive pressure.

Key success criteria will include: 

*   Communicate the business value and overall benefit to the customer
*   Identify the approach within the Cloud Adoption Framework that includes the strategy, plan, and readiness of workloads
*   Understand and communicate how Azure will address their healthcare compliance needs
*   Provide cost estimates for the proposed migration workloads
*   Move the customer through the process of validation and commitment to the proposal and business case presented

Within the process of completing this session, you will use the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework to develop a business case that will outline the strategy, plan, and readiness of workloads to Azure.  You will communicate the tools that can assist the customer with partner engagement by familiarizing them with the AMMP program.  You will communicate with the customer how moving workloads to Azure can optimize the operations and maintain compliance within their healthcare organization.  As part of the optimization, you should review the customer's licensing position, understand their cost model, and determine their overall strategy for their users, applications, and data.  


## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your table participants and trainer.

2. Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso Health is a health provider network that has grown organically and through the acquisition of other smaller healthcare organizations. Over the years, Contoso Health has seen not only its business grow, but also its on-premises presence in their private datacenter. Today, Contoso Health has over 500 servers in their datacenter that are maintained by a lean infrastructure and application support team.

Contoso Health has a longstanding relationship with Microsoft and is a current enterprise customer with an established Enterprise Agreement. Your team represents the migration project team for Contoso Health. You have been tasked with evaluating the processes and tooling and programs that can be used to assess, test, and eventually migrate the workloads to Microsoft Azure and coordinate the use of Microsoft CSP partners, where necessary.

To validate that Microsoft Azure will be able to accommodate Contoso Health's existing servers and applications, a collection of servers has been identified by IT leadership and the business which are representative of Contoso's on-premises estate. While these servers are representative of the current on-premises estate, they are also an existing production system that is critical to the business.

### Customer needs

Limiting risk while maintaining compliance. While the applications selected for this migration effort are representative of Contoso Health's on-premises estate, the are also production systems.
Extend in a stable way. Without access to the source code, the applications cannot be easily modified and are considered stable today. Stability during and after the migration is critical and cannot come at the cost of modernization.

IT leadership's goals for this initial migration to Azure include:

1. Validate the migration of workloads hosted on legacy Linux and Windows operating systems including Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012 R2 as well as systems hosted on Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, to take advantage of the additional time offered for vendor support.
  
2. Modernize systems to improve availability and resiliency where possible within the timelines needed for rapid migration. While the overarching goal is to re-host existing systems, where meaningful improvements can be made, they should be.
  
3. Investigate the potential modernization of application components by evaluating and eventually transitioning to platform services where possible after issues around vendor support have been addressed.
  
4. Educate the business and Contoso Health's management on the processes and tooling that can be used to eventually move the remaining servers to Microsoft Azure, drastically reducing their on-premises presence.
   
5. Identify opportunities to optimize operational efficiency and decrease capital expenditures on IT infrastructure.

While each workload will undeniably be different due to different technologies and dependencies, the discovery in this exercise will help to instill a set of practices that can be used to move the remainder of Contoso Health's on-premises estate into Microsoft Azure reliably and predictably.

### Customer objections

1. Contoso Health has a current Enterprise Agreement for all of their Windows Server software that includes Software Assurance.  If they migrate any of their workloads to Azure, they do not have to pay for additional Windows Server licensing.
   
2. The customer currently has servers that are under-utilized most of the year, but need additional capacity during cold weather months due to a rise is health issues.  Contoso does not want to pay extra for server performance that is not used.
   
3. Contoso has servers that run workloads that require a consistent performance level. They are concerned that moving these servers will cost more in Azure.
   
4. Contoso IT staff has limited experience with server migrations and no cloud experience.  It is unlikely that they can handle this type of project along with their current mission-critical application support requirements.

5. Contoso is also discussing their migration to cloud with AWS and Google.  They want to know how Microsoft is any different in services and support.


### Common scenarios
